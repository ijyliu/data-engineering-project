## Conda Environment
The environment `data_engineering_project` can be found in `environment.yml`.

To make yourself a copy of the environment, run `conda env create -f environment.yml`. To update the environment if the yaml changes, run `conda env update --name data_engineering_project --file environment.yml --prune`.

If you have the environment activated, you can run `conda env export > environment.yml` while in this directory to update the yaml file.
